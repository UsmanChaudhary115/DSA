# Data Structures and Algorithms – Practice Repository

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental **data structures and algorithms (DSA)** in C++.  
It includes both basic and advanced variants of common structures, often implemented in multiple ways (arrays, linked lists, templates, etc.).

The purpose of this repo is learning and practicing DSA concepts during my Data Structures course.
